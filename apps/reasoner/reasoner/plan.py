"""Pure, deterministic graph logic — no IO, safe inside a Temporal workflow.

This module holds everything the per-node orchestrator (`reasoner.workflow.
DynamicWorkflow`) needs to drive ordering and skip-propagation WITHOUT touching the
DB, network, clock, or randomness. It deliberately imports nothing from `db`,
`nodes`, `httpx`, `psycopg`, or `obs`, so the workflow sandbox can import it and
recompute the identical plan on replay.

`reasoner.engine` re-exports these names so the single-activity fallback and the
per-node orchestrator share ONE implementation of the ordering/skip semantics.
