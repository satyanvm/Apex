"""Dispatcher: bridge from the Go control plane to Temporal.

The Go API creates a run row with status='queued'. Temporal is the only runtime.
This loop polls those rows and starts a Temporal workflow for each, using the run id
as the workflow id so dispatch is idempotent — a duplicate start (e.g. two reasoner
instances, or a retry) is rejected by Temporal rather than double-executing. Once a
run's plan node flips status to 'running', it stops being selected.
