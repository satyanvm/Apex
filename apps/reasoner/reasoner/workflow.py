"""The Temporal workflows that drive the reasoning graphs.

Two workflows, one per execution shape:

  • `ReasoningWorkflow` — the STATIC path. Compiles the registered LangGraph graph
    and invokes it; the LangGraphPlugin runs each static node as its own activity.
    The `route` node inside that graph decides static-vs-dynamic; a composed run is
    steered to the dynamic workflow below (started by the dispatcher).

  • `DynamicWorkflow` — the DYNAMIC path with **per-node durability**. It drives the
    topological loop in deterministic *workflow* code and invokes ONE activity per
    user node (`activities.run_node`). Each node therefore lands its own entry in
    Temporal's event history: kill the worker mid-run and Temporal replays this loop,
    serving already-completed node activities from history (NOT re-running them) and
    resuming at the in-flight node. That is real per-node checkpointing — it replaces
    the old single-activity `dynamic_node`, which re-ran the whole composed DAG on a
    crash.

The workflow bodies are deterministic: no DB, no httpx, no wall-clock, no random.
Ordering/skip logic comes from `reasoner.plan` (pure, IO-free); the composed graph
reaches the workflow via the `load_graph` activity (not a DB call in workflow
context). Every side effect happens inside an activity.
